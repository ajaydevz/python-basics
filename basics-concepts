Python is known for its readability and simplicity. Here's a quick overview:

print("Hello, World!")

# Variables and Data Types

name = "John"
age = 25
height = 1.75
is_student = False

# Lists

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

# Dictionaries

person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}

# Control Flow Statements

if age < 18:
    print("You are a minor.")
elif age >= 18 and age < 60:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a senior citizen.")

# Loops

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# Functions

def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Bob")


2. Core Python Concepts

Variables, Operators, and Expressions:

# Variables

x = 5
y = 2.5
name = "Alice"

# Arithmetic Operators

sum_result = x + y
difference = x - y
product = x * y
quotient = x / y

# Comparison Operators

is_equal = x == y
is_greater = x > y
is_not_equal = x != y

control flow statements!!

# if-else statement

if condition:
    # code to execute if the condition is True
else:
    # code to execute if the condition is False

# while loop

while condition:
    # code to execute repeatedly as long as the condition is True

# for loop

for variable in sequence:
    # code to execute for each item in the sequence
